📌 Overview
This project is a Music Playlist Management System built using SQL.
It demonstrates how to store, manage, and query music playlist data efficiently.
The database contains tables for songs, artists, albums, genres, and playlists.

📂 Features
Add, update, and delete songs in the playlist

Store artist and album details

Organize songs by genre

Create and manage playlists

Query songs based on different filters (artist, album, genre)

🛠️ Technologies Used
SQL – Database queries and schema design

MySQL / PostgreSQL – Database management system

Git & GitHub – Version control and collaboration

📑 Database Schema
Tables:

Songs – stores song details (title, duration, album_id, genre_id)

Artists – stores artist information

Albums – stores album details

Genres – stores music genres

Playlists – stores playlist details

Playlist_Songs – mapping between playlists and songs

🔍 Example Queries
Get all songs by a specific artist

Get top 10 longest songs

Find all songs in a specific playlist

Get the total duration of a playlist

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Vbatta/Music_Playlist_SQL.git
Open your SQL client (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, etc.)

Run the SQL script in music_playlist.sql

Execute queries from the queries.sql file

📜 License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.

If you want, I can also make a shorter README just with a title, description, and setup instructions so it’s quick to read. That would look cleaner for GitHub’s front page.

🎵 Music Playlist SQL Project
This project contains SQL scripts to design, manage, and query a Music Playlist Database.
It demonstrates how to create tables, insert data, and perform queries to manage songs, artists, albums, and playlists efficiently.

📂 Project Structure
create_tables.sql – Defines database schema (tables, relationships, constraints)

insert_data.sql – Adds sample songs, artists, and playlists

queries.sql – Example SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis

🚀 Features
Create and manage playlists

Store and organize songs by artists and albums

Query playlists to find songs by genre, artist, or album

Analyze music data for insights

🛠️ Technologies Used
Database: MySQL / SQL Server / PostgreSQL (compatible)

Language: SQL

📖 Usage
Open your SQL environment (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, etc.)

Run create_tables.sql to set up the database

Run insert_data.sql to populate sample data

Execute queries from queries.sql to test features
