The Music Playlist SQL project is a comprehensive SQL-based solution designed to manage and analyze a music playlist database. This project demonstrates various SQL concepts, including creating and managing tables, inserting and updating records, performing complex queries, and generating meaningful insights from the data. It focuses on real-world playlist management scenarios such as storing track information, categorizing genres, linking artists to albums, and tracking user preferences. The queries include filtering songs based on attributes, calculating playlist durations, finding popular tracks, and exploring relationships between artists, albums, and songs. This repository serves as a valuable reference for learning SQL fundamentals and advanced techniques while working with music-related datasets.
